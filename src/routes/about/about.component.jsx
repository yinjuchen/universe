          <h1>My Journey</h1>
          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>On a typical day in 2021, I stumbled upon Inoue Tomohisa's book, which painted a stark future of the economy potentially collapsing by 2030. The growing influence of AI and technology highlighted my career vulnerabilitiesâ€”my skills were becoming obsolete. This realization was daunting and enlightening, pushing me toward a field that promised resilience: coding. Despite my initial lack of enthusiasm for coding, each problem solved and bug fixed brought a profound sense of accomplishment, steering me toward a path as a full-stack developer.</p>

          <h3>Action</h3>
          <p>Balancing a full-time job, I dedicated my weekends and evenings to mastering coding. I tackled various coding challenges, absorbed countless tutorials, and embarked on side projects that stretched my abilities. My first project, "Artsync," leveraged React's robust framework to build an online art gallery. Concurrently, I utilized only Vanilla JavaScript to create "Sandwichlogy," a simple yet effective recipe app. These projects refined my coding skills and enhanced my debugging and problem-solving techniques.
